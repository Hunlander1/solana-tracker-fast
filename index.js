// ============================================================
//  SOLANA COMBINED BOT
//  ----------------------------------------------------------
//  >>> VERSION: 2026-08-28a  (FOMO trader list + 3-entry/24h-from-mint signal); prior: 2026-08-12b  (order_by stays 'volume' — 12a's change was wrong; adds hot_level capture) <<<
//  ----------------------------------------------------------
//  2026-08-12b: 12a switched the rank query from order_by:'volume' to 'default',
//  reasoning that "rank by volume" wasn't "rank on GMGN's Trending tab". Direct
//  observation of the live Trending tab on 2026-08-12 DISPROVED that: the tab's
//  column header reads "<interval> Vol ↓" and the rows descend by that interval's
//  volume. The Trending tab IS a volume sort. order_by:'volume' was correct and
//  is kept. 12a never shipped to sol; it did briefly ship to evm and is reverted
//  there too.
//  THE REAL DISCREPANCY IS FILTERING, NOT SORTING. GMGN's Trending tab shows a
//  FILTERED set (the UI Filter control is active), while this bot calls the raw
//  rank endpoint with NO filter params and so sees tokens the site hides.
//  Measured on SOL 1h, 2026-08-12: the site's top 3 were GTA / CALLOOOR /
//  Plumber, but in the unfiltered API response those sat at positions 6 / 7 / 9,
//  behind seven higher-volume tokens (Fool, AFP, TOAD, VOL, App, CATE, SPERP)
//  that the site did not list at all. Same relative order, different pool. So the
//  bot's "#1" means "#1 of a LARGER pool than the site shows" — which is exactly
//  how a token can be #1 here while absent from the Trending tab (the GMEB case).
//  Matching the site requires passing the same filter tags; that work is OPEN.
//  ADDED in 12b: capture the `hot_level` response field per token, shown in the
//  #1-Everywhere alert as a cross-check against the live site. NOTE hot_level is
//  a COARSE bucket — observed values are only 0-3, with many ties — so it is
//  usable as a filter threshold but NEVER as a rank.
//  >>> PREVIOUS: 2026-07-17w (fix: bluechip carry-forward only fills a 0, no longer locks in a stale HIGH) <<<
//  ----------------------------------------------------------
//  ONE ACTIVE SIGNAL:
//
//  BLUECHIP TRENDING BUY (CHAT_ID_SLOW)
//    Fires when ALL of the following are true:
//      1. A tracked wallet (not the token's dev) BUYS the token
//      2. The token is in the TOP 10 TRENDING on GMGN — in ANY interval
//         (1m / 5m / 1h / 6h / 24h). Top-10 in even one interval qualifies.
//      3. The token is UNDER 24 HOURS old
//      4. The token has OVER 10% BLUECHIP HOLDERS
//    Fires once per token.
//
//  CHANGE LOG:
//   2026-07-17i — CLUSTER BIG-BUY GATE. The 8-wallet cluster signal now also
//         requires that AT LEAST ONE of the 8 distinct wallets spent >= $500 USD
//         (CLUSTER_MIN_BIG_BUY_USD). Sub-$500 buys STILL count toward the wallet
//         count — 7 x $50 + 1 x $500 fires, 8 x $50 does not.
//         Supporting changes:
//           - clusterBuyers[mint] changed from a Set of addresses to a Map of
//             address -> USD spent. Size is captured at buy-time; the tx is not
//             available later.
//           - extractSolSpent() REINSTATED (removed in the 17d rewrite). Per the
//             24q/24r history it PREFERS the wSOL swap leg and falls back to the
//             native lamport delta (minus fee) — it never adds both legs, which
//             was the old ~2x double-count bug.
//           - getSolPriceUsd() (cached 60s) + buyUsdValue() convert to USD.
//           - FAIL-OPEN on unknown size: if extraction or the price lookup fails,
//             buyUsdValue returns null and the wallet counts as qualifying, so a
//             GMGN blip can never silently suppress a real cluster (same failure
//             class as the FABLE bug). A clean parsed $0 is fail-CLOSED — that's
//             a transfer-in, not a buy. Unknowns are logged.
//           - Alert now shows "Largest Buy" and per-wallet sizes, sorted desc.
//         The bluechip trending signal is UNCHANGED by this version.
//
//   2026-07-17h — FABLE BLUECHIP BUG FIX (cache staleness, NOT a merge bug).
//         Symptom: FABLE was rank 1-3 with 6+ tracked wallets buying but never
//         fired; log showed "bluechip 0.0%" while /trending showed 65.5%.
//         Root cause: refreshTrending() rebuilds trendingMap from scratch every
//         30s and commits the partial map whenever ANY interval returns tokens
//         (next.size > 0). When the 6h interval call blipped (rate limit/timeout)
//         for a cycle, FABLE landed carrying only the 1m/5m rank rows — which
//         report bluechip_owner_percentage 0 — so its cached bluechip regressed
//         to 0.0% and the signal gate skipped it. /trending was viewed on a later
//         healthy cycle, hence 65.5%. Same map, different moment.
//         Fix (two parts, display/cache only — signal gate & fire logic untouched):
//           (1) CARRY-FORWARD: after building the fresh map each cycle, keep the
//               highest bluechip a token had while it stays in the trending set,
//               so a partial refresh can't zero out a known value.
//           (2) INTERVAL RETRY: fetchTrendingInterval retries once (300ms) on a
//               blank/failed interval before giving up, reducing how often 6h
//               drops out of a rebuild in the first place.
//         The gate `rank <= TREND_TOP_WIDE && t.bluechip > TREND_MIN_BLUECHIP`,
//         all thresholds, the wallet-count/age/MC gates, and the fire decision
//         are byte-identical to 17g.
//
//   2026-07-17d — COMPLETE SIGNAL REWRITE. Removed ALL previous signals:
//         Migration detection, Post-Migration Big Buy, 10-Wallet coordination,
//         and Large Buy Cluster. Replaced with the single Bluechip Trending Buy
//         above. Added a trending poller that pulls the top 10 from all five
//         intervals of GMGN /v1/market/rank every 30s and caches the union,
//         carrying each token's bluechip_owner_percentage and creation_timestamp.
//
//         NOTE: /v1/market/rank was previously believed dead ("returns empty for
//         my key") and was deleted as dead code in 24u. That was a FALSE NEGATIVE
//         — the response is DOUBLE-nested (data.data.rank), so a single-level
//         parse found nothing. The route works fine. Re-added correctly.
//
//   [Prior change log retained below for reference]
//   24q — extractSolSpent stopped ADDING native + wSOL legs (double-count ~2x).
//   24r — extractSolSpent PREFERS the wSOL swap leg, native delta as fallback.
//   24s — MARKET CAP FIX. GMGN /v1/token/info has no market_cap field and price
//         is nested (info.price.price). Added tokenPriceUsd/tokenSupply/
//         tokenMarketCap helpers; routed all price/MC reads through them.
